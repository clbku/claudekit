# Prerequisites

To understand claudekit's architecture, you should first be familiar with these Claude Code concepts:

- **[Commands](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)** - Slash commands in markdown format that Claude interprets as instructions. Claudekit extends Claude Code with custom commands for git workflows, checkpointing, spec-driven development, and more.

- **[Subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents)** - Specialized experts that handle specific technical domains. Claudekit provides 30+ expert subagents for TypeScript, React, databases, testing, and other specialized areas.

- **[Hooks](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks)** - Event-triggered scripts that run automatically during Claude Code sessions. Claudekit's core automation comes from hooks that validate code, run tests, create checkpoints, and maintain code quality.

# Architecture

## Commands

Slash commands for common development tasks are organized into namespaces like `git:*`, `spec:*`, and `checkpoint:*`. Using the "!" prefix, they execute bash commands automatically to provide Claude context for task execution. See [command creation guide](internals/creating-commands.md) for implementation details.

## Subagents

Claudekit offers 30+ domain-specific expert subagents, categorized across areas like TypeScript, React, databases, and testing. Each subagent contains specialized instructions along with solutions to frequently encountered problems. See [subagent creation guide](internals/creating-subagents.md) for implementation details.

## Hooks

Claudekit hooks include code quality, testing, checkpointing, codebase mapping, and more. Triggering is determined by project state and transcript history, with per-session controls. See [hook creation guide](internals/creating-hooks.md) for implementation details.

## CLI

### claudekit

Project setup and component management CLI with interactive configuration.

### claudekit-hooks

Hook execution CLI with session management and profiling capabilities.

## Configuration

### Project Configuration
- `.claude/settings.json` - Hook configuration for this project
- `.claude/commands/` - Project-specific slash commands
- `.claude/agents/` - Project-specific subagents
- `.claudekit/config.json` - Claudekit settings (codebase map, etc.)

### User Configuration

- `~/.claudekit/config.json` - User-level claudekit settings
- `~/.claudekit/logs` - Hook execution logs
- `~/.claudekit/sessions` - Session tracking and context mappings

## Release pipeline

### Prepare release script

[`scripts/prepare-release.sh`](../scripts/prepare-release.sh) - Bash script that automates version bumping, testing, and release commits. Uses Claude Code in non-interactive mode to analyze code changes and update README.md and CHANGELOG.md with accurate documentation.

### Release GitHub action

[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) - Automated workflow that publishes releases when version changes are detected. Validates builds, creates git tags, publishes to npm, and generates GitHub releases with extracted changelog content.

# Basic utilities

## Validate and fix issues

Project validation and automated issue resolution.

### Commands

#### [/validate-and-fix](../src/commands/validate-and-fix.md)

Runs quality checks and automatically fixes discovered issues using parallel execution with specialized subagents, organized into risk-based phases.

**Tools**: `Bash, Task, TodoWrite, Read, Edit, MultiEdit`

**Context collection**: Available validation commands from AGENTS.md, package.json scripts, README.md, and common project patterns (lint, typecheck, test, build commands)

**Processing flow**:
1. Discovers and categorizes available quality checks by priority (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
2. Executes parallel validation using Bash to capture full output with file paths and error details
3. Assesses risks and maps issue dependencies before fixing
4. Applies fixes in phases: safe quick wins → functionality fixes → critical issues with confirmation
5. Creates git stash checkpoints between phases and verifies each fix immediately
6. Routes specialized tasks to domain expert subagents
7. Re-runs all checks for final verification and provides fix/remaining issue summary

**Output**: Real-time progress updates, confirmation of each successful fix, summary report of resolved issues vs. remaining manual tasks, and rollback instructions if fixes cause problems

## Temporary file cleanup

Repository cleanup of temporary files and debug artifacts.

### Commands

#### [/dev:cleanup](../src/commands/dev/cleanup.md)

Analyzes project workspace for debug files, test artifacts, and status reports created during development sessions, then proposes organized cleanup with .gitignore improvements.

**Tools**: `Task, Bash(git:*), Bash(echo:*), Bash(grep:*), Bash(ls:*), Bash(pwd:*), Bash(head:*), Bash(wc:*), Bash(test:*)`

**Context collection**: Git status including ignored files, working directory contents, current path, and committed files matching cleanup patterns (debug-*, test-*, *_SUMMARY.md, temp-*, etc.)

**Processing flow**:
1. Launches subagent to analyze git status output
2. Checks working directory state to determine cleanup scope (untracked/ignored only vs. including committed files)
3. Applies safety rules to identify cleanup candidates without touching core project files
4. Categorizes findings into untracked files, committed files, and temporary directories
5. Generates deletion proposals with appropriate commands (rm vs git rm)
6. Analyzes cleanup patterns to suggest .gitignore improvements
7. Requests explicit user approval before any file operations

**Output**: Categorized cleanup proposal with file lists, specific deletion commands, suggested .gitignore patterns to prevent future accumulation, and confirmation request before proceeding

## Thinking level

Automatic keyword injection that replaces the need to manually prompt Claude with thinking keywords.

```
User Input: "Help me fix this bug"
     │
     ▼
[Check configured level: 2]
     │
     ▼
[Map level to keyword: "megathink"]
     │
     ▼
[Prepend to prompt: "megathink\nHelp me fix this bug"]
     │
     ▼
[Send to Claude processing]
```

**Architecture**: Level configuration (0-3) maps to thinking keywords: 0=none, 1=think, 2=megathink, 3=ultrathink. Keywords are prepended with newline before Claude receives the prompt. Token usage increases with level: level 2 approximately 2.5x baseline, level 3 approximately 8x baseline.

### Hooks

#### [thinking-level](guides/thinking-level.md)

Prepends thinking keywords to user prompts before processing.

**Triggers**: `UserPromptSubmit` events with universal matcher

**Implementation**: Maps configured level (0-3) to thinking keywords (none, think, megathink, ultrathink), prepends keyword with newline to user prompt, validates level bounds with fallback to default level 2

**Behavior**: Modifies prompts before Claude processing without changing user interface, configurable performance impact (level 2: ~2.5x tokens, level 3: ~8x tokens), operates transparently during normal workflow

## Session-based hook control

Hook execution control during Claude Code sessions that preserves repository settings while allowing individual preferences.

```
Repository Config: .claude/settings.json
     │        [hooks: enabled globally]
     ▼
[Claude Code Session Start]
     │
     ▼
~/.claudekit/sessions/uuid.json
     │  {
     │    "disabledHooks": ["typecheck"],
     │    "sessionId": "abc123"
     │  }
     ▼
[Session-specific behavior]
     │  • typecheck disabled for this user
     │  • repository config unchanged
     ▼
[Session End] ──► [State cleared]
                       │
                       ▼
                 [Back to repository defaults]

## Research

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b188fabc-0d8f-4896-949c-04953057ee6c

Orchestrator-worker research coordination using query classification and artifact-based synthesis to enable complex parallel investigation.

```
Query Analysis:
User Query → [Classify: breadth/depth/factual] → [Determine agent count]
     │                   │                            │
     ▼                   ▼                            ▼
[Complex topic?]  [Research strategy]         [Spawn 3-10 agents]

Parallel Execution:
Lead Agent → [research-expert A: angle 1] → [artifact-A.md]
     │       [research-expert B: angle 2] → [artifact-B.md]
     │       [research-expert C: angle 3] → [artifact-C.md]
     ▼
[Read all artifacts] → [Synthesize findings] → [Final report]
```

**Architecture**: Uses orchestrator-worker pattern where lead agent analyzes query complexity and spawns specialized research-expert subagents with distinct investigation angles. Subagents write findings to filesystem artifacts rather than direct return, enabling larger research volumes and preserving individual agent reports for user inspection. Lead agent synthesizes all artifacts into final report.

**Inspiration**: Based on Anthropic's [multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system) architecture, adapted for Claude Code.

2. Spawns appropriate number of research-expert subagents concurrently with mode indicators (quick verification, focused investigation, or deep research)
3. Assigns specific research angles to each subagent with overlapping perspectives for depth-first or independent aspects for breadth-first queries
4. Collects filesystem artifact references from each subagent rather than full reports
5. Reads and synthesizes findings from all research artifact files
6. Consolidates sources, deduplicates information, and identifies cross-report themes
7. Generates final comprehensive report with merged insights and consolidated bibliography

**Output**: Executive summary with synthesized findings, path to comprehensive final report file, key insights, and consolidated source references

### Subagents

#### [research-expert](../src/agents/research-expert.md)

## Checkpointing

Git-based state preservation system that creates perfect snapshots without modifying working directory files, solving the workflow disruption problem of traditional git stash operations.

```
Traditional Stash (Disruptive):
Working Directory: [your changes]
        │
        ▼
[git stash push] ──► Working Directory: [clean, changes lost]
        │                     │
        ▼                     ▼
Stash List: [saved]    [context disrupted]

Claudekit Approach (Non-Destructive):
Working Directory: [your changes] ──► [unchanged throughout]
        │
        ▼
[git add -A] ──► Index: [staged temporarily]
        │
        ▼
[git stash create] ──► Stash Object: [perfect snapshot]
        │
        ▼
[git stash store] ──► Stash List: [checkpoint saved]
        │
        ▼
[git reset] ──► Index: [restored to original]
        │
        ▼
Working Directory: [still your changes, context preserved]
```

**Architecture**: The git stash create/store pattern creates stash objects without modifying the working directory. Files are temporarily staged to create a complete snapshot, then the index is reset while the stash object is preserved in the stash list. This enables fearless experimentation with perfect recovery points.

### Hooks

#### [create-checkpoint](guides/checkpoint.md)

Automatic backup system for Claude Code sessions using git stash create/store pattern to preserve work without disrupting workflow.

**Triggers**: `Stop` and `SubagentStop` events with universal matcher

**Implementation**: Git status detection, temporary staging, stash object creation, index reset, and automatic cleanup of aged checkpoints

**Behavior**: Silent execution without workflow interruption, provides backup safety net without modifying working directory

### Commands

#### [/checkpoint:create](../src/commands/checkpoint/create.md)

Manual checkpoint creation using git stash create/store pattern with working directory preservation and descriptive messaging.

**Tools**: `Bash(git stash:*), Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*)`

**Context collection**: Current working directory status and uncommitted changes analysis

**Processing flow**:
1. Analyzes current git status to determine if checkpoint is needed
2. Generates descriptive checkpoint message from arguments or timestamp
3. Temporarily stages all files using git add for snapshot creation
4. Creates stash object without affecting working directory using git stash create
5. Stores stash in stash list with descriptive message using git stash store
6. Resets index to restore original working directory state
7. Confirms checkpoint creation and displays saved content summary

**Output**: Checkpoint confirmation with descriptive message and preserved working directory state

#### [/checkpoint:restore](../src/commands/checkpoint/restore.md)

**Tools**: `Bash(git stash:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git reset:*), Bash(grep:*), Bash(head:*)`

**Context collection**: Available claude-checkpoint stashes, current working directory status, and target checkpoint specification from arguments

**Processing flow**:
1. Parses argument to determine target checkpoint (latest, specific number, or validation error)
2. Checks for uncommitted changes and creates automatic backup stash if needed
3. Applies target checkpoint using git stash apply while preserving checkpoint in stash list
4. Handles merge conflicts gracefully with informative error reporting
5. Provides recovery instructions for backed-up changes if restoration conflicts occur
6. Displays restoration confirmation with checkpoint details and backup information

**Output**: Restoration confirmation with checkpoint details, backup stash references for recovery, and conflict resolution guidance

#### [/checkpoint:list](../src/commands/checkpoint/list.md)

Lists all Claude Code checkpoints with formatted metadata display.

**Tools**: `Bash(git stash:*)`

**Context collection**: Git stash list analysis for claude-checkpoint entries and timestamp extraction

**Processing flow**:
1. Retrieves complete git stash list and filters for claude-checkpoint entries
2. Parses stash entries to extract stash index, branch name, and checkpoint descriptions
3. Queries git log for accurate timestamp information for each checkpoint stash
4. Formats checkpoint data into readable table with index numbers, timestamps, descriptions, and branch context
5. Handles empty checkpoint list with helpful guidance for creating first checkpoint

**Output**: Formatted checkpoint list with stash indices, timestamps, descriptions, and branch information, or guidance for creating first checkpoint

## Codebase map

Context injection system that provides code structure overview at session start with incremental updates on file changes.

```
Session Start:
[Generate codebase map] → [Session tracking] → [9000 char limit]
        │                        │                     │
        ▼                        ▼                     ▼
[Include/exclude      [Prevent duplicate      [Truncate if
 patterns]             injection]              needed]

File Changes During Session:
File Edit → [5-second debounce] → [Update specific file index]
     │              │                        │
     ▼              ▼                        ▼
[Filter: code   [Prevent rapid         [Index maintained
 files only]     regeneration]          for next session]
```

**Architecture**: Session tracking prevents duplicate context injection. Incremental updates modify index entries for changed files rather than full regeneration. 5-second debouncing prevents excessive updates during rapid editing. 9000 character limits with truncation ensure consistent performance.

### Hooks

#### [codebase-map](guides/codebase-map.md)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19a767d5-bc95-441c-9015-73d099391be0

Session-based context provider that generates and injects codebase structure overview once per session with configurable filtering and format options.

**Triggers**: `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` events with universal matcher

**Implementation**: Generates codebase map using configurable include/exclude patterns and format options, auto-detects package manager to resolve `codebase-map` CLI (npx/yarn dlx/pnpm dlx), implements session tracking to prevent duplicate context injection, includes performance limits and truncation for large codebases, supports both DSL and tree output formats

**Behavior**: Provides context once per session with 9000 character limit for UserPromptSubmit events, sessions are tracked to avoid duplicate injection, graceful fallback on generation failures without blocking user workflow

#### [codebase-map-update](guides/codebase-map.md)

Incremental codebase map updater that maintains index freshness by updating specific files on modification with debouncing to prevent excessive regeneration.

**Triggers**: `PostToolUse` events matching `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`

**Implementation**: Debounces updates with 5-second delay, filters for code file extensions (ts, tsx, js, jsx, mjs, cjs), auto-resolves codebase-map CLI via package manager, updates specific files in codebase-map index rather than full regeneration, silent failure handling to avoid workflow disruption

**Behavior**: Updates index file incrementally without interrupting development workflow, skips updates if codebase-map tool unavailable or no index exists, maintains index accuracy for subsequent session starts

## File guard

Analyzes bash commands and extracts file paths before tool execution, preventing access to sensitive files through dynamic command parsing rather than static pattern matching.

```
Static Permissions (Claude Code built-in):
User: "find . -name '*.env' | xargs cat"
       │
       ▼
[Pattern Check: Read(./.env)] ──► ALLOWED (doesn't match exact pattern)
       │
       ▼
[Tool executes, sensitive data exposed]

Dynamic Analysis (Claudekit):
User: "find . -name '*.env' | xargs cat"
       │
       ▼
[Parse bash command] ──► [Extract: find, xargs cat]
       │                        │
       ▼                        ▼
[Analyze pipeline] ──► [Predicted paths: .env files]
       │
       ▼
[Check against patterns] ──► BLOCKED (.env matches protection)
       │
       ▼
[Access denied before execution]
```

**Architecture**: Parses bash command syntax to extract file path operations before tool execution. Handles pipeline operations, glob expansion, and variable substitution that static deny patterns cannot catch. Uses ignore file patterns for protection rules while understanding command semantics.

### Hooks

#### [file-guard](guides/file-guard.md)

Blocks AI file access operations before execution by analyzing bash commands and extracting target file paths.

**Triggers**: `PreToolUse` events matching `Read|Edit|MultiEdit|Write|Bash`

**Implementation**: Loads ignore file patterns for protection rules, parses bash commands to extract file path candidates, applies security heuristics to detect sensitive pipeline operations, validates file paths against protection patterns, provides detailed denial reasons with pattern sources

**Behavior**: Blocks access before tool execution with informative error messages, allows non-sensitive file operations to proceed normally, special handling for bash commands with path extraction and pipeline analysis

## Quality checks

Code quality validation hooks that detect common anti-patterns and incomplete work during development.

### Hooks

#### check-unused-parameters

Detects lazy refactoring patterns where function parameters are prefixed with underscores instead of being properly removed.

**Triggers**: `PostToolUse` events matching `Edit|MultiEdit`

**Implementation**: Scans edited code for underscore-prefixed parameters in function declarations, arrow functions, methods, and constructors using regex patterns for TypeScript and JavaScript syntax variations

**Behavior**: Blocks commits when underscore-prefixed parameters are detected in code edits, encourages proper parameter removal over lazy underscore prefixing

#### [check-comment-replacement](guides/check-comment-replacement.md)

Detects incomplete development work where functional code has been replaced with placeholder comments.

**Triggers**: `PostToolUse` events matching `Edit|MultiEdit`

**Implementation**: Analyzes edit operations to identify when code is replaced with comment lines, supports multiple comment syntaxes (single-line, block, hash, SQL, HTML), validates edit patterns for comment replacement violations

**Behavior**: Blocks operations when code-to-comment replacement is detected, prevents incomplete refactoring from being committed, provides specific feedback about violated lines

#### check-todos

Response completion validator that ensures all todo items are finished before Claude stops responding.

**Triggers**: `Stop` and `SubagentStop` events with universal matcher

**Implementation**: Parses transcript to extract latest todo state, identifies incomplete tasks by status analysis, blocks Claude from stopping when unfinished todos exist

**Behavior**: Prevents Claude from finishing responses when tasks remain incomplete, enforces task completion discipline with detailed list of incomplete items, allows Claude to stop only when all todos are completed

## Typescript type checking

TypeScript type safety validation through compilation checks and 'any' type detection.

### Hooks

#### [check-any-changed](../cli/hooks/check-any-changed.ts)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d270f706-c316-468a-9bb1-968726c3f6ae

Forbids 'any' types in TypeScript files through content parsing and pattern detection.

**Triggers**: `PostToolUse` events with `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` matcher

**Implementation**: Content cleaning to remove strings and comments, regex pattern matching for forbidden 'any' type declarations, line-by-line analysis with test utility exclusions

**Behavior**: Blocks execution when 'any' types detected, provides specific line numbers and replacement suggestions with proper type examples

#### [typecheck-changed](../cli/hooks/typecheck-changed.ts)

### Hooks

#### [lint-changed](../cli/hooks/lint-changed.ts)

Runs linting validation on individual file changes using project-configured tools like Biome and ESLint.

**Triggers**: `PostToolUse` events with `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` matcher

**Implementation**: Tool detection via configuration files, parallel execution of multiple linters, file extension filtering with configurable patterns, automatic fix application when enabled

**Behavior**: Validates only modified files, supports both Biome and ESLint simultaneously, formatted error output with file paths and line numbers, blocks on any linting violations

#### [lint-project](../cli/hooks/lint-project.ts)

Project-wide linting validation using full codebase scans after Claude finishes responding.

**Triggers**: `Stop` and `SubagentStop` events with universal matcher

**Implementation**: Full project linting with configurable timeouts, tool availability detection, formatted error aggregation across multiple linters

**Behavior**: Comprehensive code quality validation after response completion, combined error reporting for easy navigation, blocks Claude from stopping on lint violations

## Test running

Automated test execution for changed files and full project validation with intelligent test discovery.

### Hooks

#### [test-changed](../cli/hooks/test-changed.ts)

Runs tests related to modified files using pattern-based test discovery and execution.

**Triggers**: `PostToolUse` events with `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` matcher

**Implementation**: Related test file discovery through naming patterns, test file exclusion to prevent recursive execution, configurable file extensions and test commands

**Behavior**: Targets only tests related to changed files, suggests test file creation when none found, provides detailed failure guidance with fix recommendations, blocks on any test failures

#### [test-project](../cli/hooks/test-project.ts)

Full test suite execution with timeout handling and comprehensive error reporting.

**Triggers**: `Stop` and `SubagentStop` events with universal matcher

**Implementation**: Package.json script detection, configurable test commands and timeouts, robust timeout handling with actionable recommendations

**Behavior**: Complete project test validation after response completion, timeout protection with configuration guidance, formatted test output for debugging, blocks Claude from stopping on test failures

## Self-review

**Architecture**: Parses conversation transcript to track review markers and file changes. Selects one random question from each focus area (default: Implementation Completeness, Code Quality, Integration & Refactoring, Codebase Consistency). Custom focus areas completely replace defaults. Fully configurable file patterns and question pools enable team-specific review workflows.

### Hooks

#### [self-review](guides/self-review.md)

Prompts Claude with randomized critical questions from configurable focus areas when file changes are detected since the last review marker in conversation transcript.

**Triggers**: `Stop` and `SubagentStop` events with universal matcher

**Implementation**: Transcript parsing to detect file changes since last review marker, randomized question selection from built-in focus areas (integration issues, error handling, edge cases, performance, security, testing) plus user-defined custom topics and questions, integration detection with code-review-expert subagent, stop hook loop prevention, target pattern filtering

**Behavior**: Blocks Claude from stopping until self-review questions are addressed, tracks review completion with unique transcript markers, suggests code-review-expert subagent when available, skips when no file changes detected, fully customizable focus areas and question pools for team-specific review patterns

### Subagents

#### [code-review-expert](../src/agents/code-review-expert.md)

Comprehensive code review specialist suggested by self-review hook for deeper analysis of identified concerns across six focus areas.

**Tools**: `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`
**Specialization**: Root cause analysis for self-review concerns, cross-file intelligence to identify related issues, solution-oriented feedback with working code examples, pattern detection for implementation completeness and codebase consistency validation
